# Portfolio_Script

### Background ###
It all started when i was using InvestmentMoats's Investment Stock Tracker.

When Yahoo, which got bought over by Verizon, decided to shut down the Yahoo Finance API, we are uanble to obtain realtime live stock prices. A solution was posted by Kyith(founder of InvestmentMoats) such that he will update the closing prices at the end of everday and we import the data from his googlesheet.

However, i feel that it is not a flexible solution (in the sense that we have to wait for him to update the prices) and getting the data myself is worth a try

Granted there were quite a few modules written for what i was attempting, i find that this project may benefit me in the future as i am also able to learn and brush up on webscraping skills at the same time.

Hence the motivation for this project.
